**Like many businesses who have been forced to adapt to new ways of working remotely in this past year, you’ll likely have experienced a rise in demand for digital skills within your team, to support this new business model brought on by the lockdowns across the UK.**

Across all sectors, as the demand for digital services and solutions increases rapidly, talented [technical employees are becoming far more valuable to our organisations and teams](https://thecodersguild.org.uk/blog/hiring-developer-apprentice-sme-thrive-2021/), but it’s crucial people are getting the right training to deliver what’s required. 

That’s why the government is investing £2.5 billion for the National Skills Fund, because now more than ever digital skills training is crucial to driving workforce growth and diversity, and unlocking the full potential of the UK tech industry. 

This funding is being used to create [a range of digital skills boot camps to train people in need of new career opportunities, and to help businesses get on the road to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.](https://www.skillsbootcamps.com/)

The Coders Guild is delighted to announce we’ll be a part of this exciting new initiative, in partnership with the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA). [We’ll be providing comprehensive courses in web development, UX design, and software testing.](https://thecodersguild.org.uk/blog/free-tech-boot-camps-for-west-yorkshire/)

We’ll be training and prepare the next generation of people in West Yorkshire eager to make a positive impact on the technology industry in the UK, and we’d like to invite you to get involved as well.
