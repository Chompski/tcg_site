Yorkshire has been chosen as the base for an exciting project to make tech education more accessible for everyone, create career opportunities for people from under-represented groups, and close the digital skills gap for local businesses in the process.

Since the start of this year, we’ve been providing comprehensive digital skills training to 135 talented people from the local area. Over 50% of those learners are female, and a large contingent come from the BAME community, with an emphasis on promoting diversity and equality within the local tech industry. 

Course participants have been trained by experienced professionals in digital skills such as **web and app development, UX, and software testing**, as well as things like project management and real-world problem solving. 

#### Now they’re ready to start work.

This is a unique opportunity to close the gap in your team’s digital skillset, promote diversity and equality within the workplace, and drive growth and success for the local tech industry. 

If you hire one of these course graduates as an apprentice, not only will you gain an extremely valuable new team member, you’ll also gain a range of additional benefits, including: 

* **£2,000 government funding per apprentice** 
* **Competitive differentiation** 
* **Free industry-led training**
* **Support through the hiring process**
* **No recruitment fees!**

Join us in unlocking the full potential of the local community and help Yorkshire continue to drive the UK tech sector into the future.
