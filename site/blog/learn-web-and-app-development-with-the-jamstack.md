Now more than ever, digital skills training is a great way to open up new opportunities, and give yourself a better chance of enjoying a long, successful career in a digital-first world.

That’s why the government is investing £2.5 billion for the National Skills Fund through the Department for Education, and The Coders Guild is excited to announce that we’ll be a part of this programme. 

Working in partnership with the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA), we’re providing FREE training courses to help you gain valuable, relevant digital skills, and support you in realising your full potential for a brighter future. 

We have a long list of businesses of all shapes and sizes across West Yorkshire who are actively looking to hire talented people like you through this programme, with the number of web and app developer jobs set to rise significantly in 2021.

In addition to direct access to those employers, participants on this course will also come away with: 

* Coaching in modern employability skills, and guidance through developer role-specific hiring processes
* Invitations to employer engagement events, and help finding a job where you can use the developer skills you’ll have learned
* A high-demand digital skill-set needed by employers today, which is also emerging as a very popular way to do web development

Being able to build apps using the JAMStack is a skill-set which is in high demand among employers right now, and that demand is only set to continue rising in 2021 and beyond.

With that in mind, this course is ideal for anyone with a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS looking to embrace the future of coding and move forward into a more engaging and successful career. 

“JAMstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity.”

On this course, we’ll be recapping the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as well as teaching accessibility and responsive design principles. Then we’ll look at solving problems with JavaScript, and explore the tools and frameworks which you’ll use to master the skills of modern development.

This is a course for people wanting to move to the next level in coding to launch a new career. Whether you’re just getting started and have dabbled in HTML and CSS before, or are already working in a basic developer role in different languages, this is a great opportunity to learn valuable new skills fast.
